# Hello there beautiful people ðŸ˜„ 

### Welcome to my happy place!
<br />
I am a postdoc in the School of Biological Sciences, at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I am interested in studying the systematics of cryptic bat species, species delimitation, and delineation, the evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. Currently, I am studying bat movements using stable isotopes, dietary ecology, and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform-sympatric species, the macroevolutionary of bats in general, and island biogeography. Well, a bit here and there and it's so much fun! ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡
