# Hello there beautiful people ðŸ˜„ 

### Welcome to my happy place!


I am a postdoc in the School of Biological Sciences, at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I am interested in studying the systematics of cryptic bat species, species delimitation, and delineation, the evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. Currently, I am studying bat movements using stable isotopes, dietary ecology, and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform-sympatric species, the macroevolutionary of bats in general, and island biogeography. Well, a bit here and there and it's so much fun! ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡


Other than laboratory and computer work, I am a happy caver and love my activities in subterranean habitats. My hobby of exploring and adventuring in underground habitats has helped me to enjoy my research activities in the field. For me personally, being a biologist should be a combination of field + lab + data analysis skillsets. Therefore, I am always trying to improve my skillsets in all aspects and hone the skills that I have. Happy to share all the things that I learned here, while the story in the field will be available soon on my webpage! (still under development, please wait).
