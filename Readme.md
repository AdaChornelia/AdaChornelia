# Hello there, beautiful species! 👊😏

## Welcome to my happy place!!

### 🦇 About me
I am currently a postdoc at [School of BioSciences](https://biosciences.unimelb.edu.au/), at [the University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), under Alice Hughes's lab. I am particularly interested in studying the systematics of cryptic bat species, species delimitation, and delineation, the evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. My recent project is related to understanding bat migration using stable isotopes, while also working on dietary ecology and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform-sympatric species, the macroevolutionary ecology of bats in general, and island biogeography. The common link between these topics is to understand the ecology and evolution of bats and to utilize systematic studies as the root for the other topic branches.


I enjoy caving and exploring underground habitats, which is really helpful for my field research. I believe that a biologist should have skills in fieldwork, lab work, and data analysis, so I will continually try to improve in all areas. I look forward to sharing what I've learned, and my field story will be available soon on my webpage! (still under development, please wait). 

### 🦇 Expertise
My work encompasses an interdisciplinary approach, integrating various domains including taxonomy and systematics, field sampling, taxonomic identification, caving, bioacoustics, phylogenetics, molecular dating, trait analysis, historical biogeography, ecology, and bat migration, as well as barcoding, metabarcoding, and isotopes.


I'm eager to explore the possibilities or collaboration works, please feel free to reach out!
