### HI!
<br />

<br />
I am a graduate student working in Asia at the Landscape Ecology Group, Center for Integrative Conservation, XTBG, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My PhD project focuses on bats Systematic, Ecology and Evolution in particular for cryptic bats species by using acoustic, genetic and morphology.
<br />

<br />
I am a learner, learning about everything, and a self-taught on the data analysis and this page has been used to stored all related packages and all related data analysis programs I am using in my PhD project. One of my favorite analysis I am running so far is ancestral range estimation which implemented in R package BioGeoBEARS, and currently I am digging in phylogenetic comparative methods. Aside than that, I have been using widerange of phylogenetic-related programs and species delimitation such as MAFFT, IQTREE, MrBAYES, BEAST, BPP etc which forked in this page for easy access as future references. Currently I am learning again the basic of Python, SQL, and SWIFT and one of sideproject I am doing for (after PhD/ expected by June 2022) is image recognition using deep learning and neural networks.

As a side note, I am a proud field biologist; spending most of the time in the field collecting data in the caves and karsts. Story in the field can be see at https://chorneliaa.wixsite.com/cavebats
