### Hi there!
<br />
I am a graduate student working in Asia. My PhD project focuses on bats Systematic, Ecology and Evolution using acoustic, genetic and morphology.
<br />

<br />
I am a learner, learning about everything, and a self-taught on the data analysis and this page has been used to stored all related packages and all related data analysis programs I am using in my PhD project. One of my favorite analysis I am running so far is ancestral range estimation which implemented in R package BioGeoBEARS, and currently I am digging in phylogenetic comparative methods. Aside than that, I have been using widerange of phylogenetic-related programs and species delimitation such as MAFFT, IQTREE, MrBAYES, BEAST, BPP etc which forked in this page for easy access as future references.

As a side note, I am a proud field biologist; spending most of the time in the field collecting data in the caves and karsts. Story in the field can be see at https://chorneliaa.wixsite.com/cavebats
