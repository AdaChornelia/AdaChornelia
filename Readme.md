# Hello there, beautiful people!

### Welcome to my happy place!


I am a postdoc in the School of Biological Sciences, at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I am interested in studying the systematics of cryptic bat species, species delimitation, and delineation, the evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. Currently, I am studying bat movements using stable isotopes, dietary ecology, and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform-sympatric species, the macroevolutionary of bats in general, and island biogeography. Well, a bit here and there and it's so much fun! 🦇🦇🦇


Besides laboratory and computer work, I enjoy caving and being a caver, and I love the activities in subterranean habitats. My hobby of exploring and adventuring in underground habitats has helped me enjoy my field research activities. Being a biologist ideally should have a combination of field + lab + data analysis skillsets. Therefore, I always try to improve my skillsets in all aspects and hone my skills. I am happy to share everything I learned here, and the story in the field will be available soon on my webpage! (still under development, please wait).
