# Hello there, beautiful people! 👊😏

## Welcome to my happy place!!

### 🦇 About me
I am a postdoc at School of BioSciences, at the University of Melbourne [UoM](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), under Alice Hughes's lab. I am particularly interested in studying the systematics of cryptic bat species, species delimitation, and delineation, the evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. Currently, I am studying bat movements using stable isotopes, while also working on dietary ecology and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform-sympatric species, the macroevolutionary ecology of bats in general, and island biogeography. The common link between these topics is to understand the ecology and evolution of bats and to utilize systematic studies as the root for the other topic branches.


I enjoy caving and exploring underground habitats, which enhance my field research activities. A biologist should have skills in fieldwork, lab work, and data analysis, so I continually strive to improve in all areas. I look forward to sharing what I've learned, and my field story will be available soon on my webpage! (still under development, please wait). Staying updated with the latest research and methods is key for my growth in biology and helps me expand my knowledge in various areas of interest.


### 🦇 Expertise
My work encompasses an interdisciplinary approach, integrating various domains including taxonomy and systematics, field sampling, taxonomic identification, caving, bioacoustics, phylogenetics, molecular dating, trait analysis, historical biogeography, ecology, and bat migration, as well as barcoding, metabarcoding, and isotopes.


I'm eager to explore the possibilities and see how we can complement each other's strengths. Please feel free to reach out, and let's discuss how we can collaborate effectively
