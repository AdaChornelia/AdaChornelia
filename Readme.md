# Hello there, beautiful people! 👊😏

## Welcome to my happy place!

### 🦇 About me
I am a [postdoc](https://www.biosch.hku.hk/postdoctoral-scholars/) in the [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.biosch.hku.hk/), at the University of Hong Kong [HKU](https://www.hku.hk/). I am particularly interested in studying the systematics of cryptic bat species, species delimitation, and delineation, the evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. Currently, I am studying bat movements using stable isotopes, while also working on dietary ecology and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform-sympatric species, the macroevolutionary of bats in general, and island biogeography. The common link between these topics is to understand the ecology and evolution of bats and to utilize systematics studies as the root for the other topic branches.


Besides laboratory and computer work, I enjoy caving and being a caver, and I love the activities in subterranean habitats. My hobby of exploring and adventuring in underground habitats has helped me enjoy my field research activities. Being a biologist ideally should have a combination of field + lab + data analysis skillsets. Therefore, I always try to improve my skillsets in all aspects and hone my skills. I am happy to share everything I learned here, and the story in the field will be available soon on my webpage! (still under development, please wait).

### 🦇 Skillsets
I'm a lifelong learner who always has an appetite for discovering new things and exploring different areas of interest, particularly in the realm of analysis, concepts, taxa groups, and other fascinating biological fields. My undergraduate thesis revolved around studying the genetics population and karyotype (mapping the metaphase chromosomes) of Diadem's round leaf bats (*Hipposideros diadema*). It was an exciting project as I got to investigate how populations of these bats were affected by the physical barrier of mountain ranges stretching across Sumatra Island.

During this time, I gained invaluable experience in conducting scientific research, collecting data in the field, carrying out lab work, analyzing the data, and writing up my findings. This phase of my life played a crucial role in shaping my current path. As I pursued my master's degree, I delved into various taxa, from small mammals and birds to freshwater fishes. I had the opportunity to travel to different places and engage in numerous fieldwork endeavors. The support and knowledge I received from my peers, teachers, mentors, and friends were invaluable in my growth.

For my master's thesis, I had the chance to work in a biomolecular lab, where I explored the phylogenetic relationship of Hipposideridae in Southeast Asia. Alongside this, I actively participated in various projects, grants, workshops, and courses, expanding my skill set even further. My passion for learning led me to China for my PhD degree, where I focused on the systematics and evolution of bats. During this time, I broadened my fieldwork experiences, honed my skills in bioacoustics, started learning coding, and enhanced my analytical abilities for evolutionary studies.

Following the completion of my doctorate, I jumped right into a postdoctoral position, where I currently investigate bat movements using stable isotopes. This opportunity has allowed me to continue building on the skills I've acquired throughout my academic journey. However, my thirst for knowledge is insatiable, and I'm always eager to learn more from anyone who can contribute to my growth. So, let's keep the learning journey going! :)
