# Hi there beautiful people ~ ~ 😄
### Welcome to my happy place!
<br />
I am a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Biological Sciences, at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). My PhD project is focused on bats Systematics, Ecology, and Evolution. I study the systematic and evolution of cryptic species, species delimitation and delineation, the evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, and as well as bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. Currently, I studying bats movements using stable isotopes, dietary ecology, and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform-sympatric species and the macroevolutionary of bats in general, as well as biogeography. Well, a bit here and there and it's so much fun ! 🦇🦇🦇 Also, I love frogs 🐸🐸🐸

Cheers!
