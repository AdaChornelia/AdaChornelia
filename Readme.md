## Hi there beautiful people ~ ~ 
### Welcome to my happy place!
<br />
I graduated from Ph.D. program (yayy) June 2022. Currently navigating my new life as a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Biological Sciences, at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I still continue my bat-related work in Asia, as a continuous passion since undergrads and I have carried it (and dragged it) along the (not so smooth) way till this stage. My Ph.D. project focuses on bats Systematics, Ecology, and Evolution where I study the systematic and evolution of cryptic species, species delimitation and delineation, evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, and as well as bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. Currently, I am continuing my research to assess the bats movements using stable isotopes, dietary ecology, and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform-sympatric species and the macroevolutionary of bats in general, as well as biogeography. Well, a bit here and there, and they are all exciting (also terrifying).

However, I am still a learner, willing to learn about everything, trying to keep up with the latest advanced statistical analyses and methodology in sciences (...the struggle is real!). I am a self-taught in data analysis and utilized this GitHub platform to store all related packages and all related data analysis programs <including my stupid notes about anything basic>. One of my favorite analyses I am running so far is ancestral range estimation which was implemented in the R package BioGeoBEARS, and still expanding to get better and more robust results. Aside from that, I have been using a wide range of phylogenetic-related programs and species delimitations such as MAFFT, IQTREE, MrBAYES, BEAST, BPP, etc which are forked on this page for easy access as future references. Future excitement for me, personally, including bioinformatics analysis <will be stored on this page>. My favorite quote: "No matter which field of work you want to go in, it is of great importance to learn at least one programming language". â€• Ram Ray

As a side note, I am a proud field biologist; spending most of my time collecting data in the caves and karsts. My field sites cover underground habitats across Southern China to Southeast Asia. A future ambitious plan includes field sampling in archipelagoes around Asia including my home country, Indonesia, and expecting to hop around the Philippines too. The story in the field is temporarily available here: https://chorneliaa.wixsite.com/cavebats, as I am still trying to code my webpage from scratch at the moment \^.^/.<update: that website is currently offline as I am trying to maintaining the content and updating some more stuff>

Cheers!
