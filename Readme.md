### HI!
<br />

<br />
I am a graduate student working in Asia at the Landscape Ecology Group, Center for Integrative Conservation, XTBG, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My PhD project focuses on bats Systematic, Ecology and Evolution in particular for cryptic bats species by using acoustic, genetic and morphological data to answer the basic question about diversification of bats and seeking the evolutionary processes underlying the speciation in bats. Bats is the excellent models to studying evolutionary, not only as the only one of mammals who capable on true flight, but also their evolutionary succes on occupied widerange of niches in night and it's evolutionary success on ability of emitting calls on high calls frequency for navigation, hunting, and communications. Therefore, bioacoustic is important element on studying bats, however, this traits can't be use alone as standard in species identification as many of bat species are cryptic.

I am a learner, learning about everything, and a self-taught on the data analysis and this page has been used to stored all related packages and all related data analysis programs I am using in my PhD project. One of my favorite analysis I am running so far is ancestral range estimation which implemented in R package BioGeoBEARS, and currently I am digging in phylogenetic comparative methods. Aside than that, I have been using widerange of phylogenetic-related programs and species delimitation such as MAFFT, IQTREE, MrBAYES, BEAST, BPP etc which forked in this page for easy access as future references. Currently I am learning again the basic of Python, SQL, and SWIFT and one of sideproject I am doing for (after PhD/ expected by June 2022) is image recognition using deep learning and neural networks.

I am a proud field biologist, spending most of the time in the field collecting bats data in the caves and karsts across South China and Southeast Asia-which now, I am hoping to expand my study to the south, Indonesia archipelago-my home country. My caving activities started in 2011 with basic caves exploration and caves mapping until 2013 where I started caving for collecting data for my undergraduate research (graduated in 2014) until 2016 when I graduated from master degree in Andalas University in Sumatra Island and continue my explorations to karst area in Asia continent under supervision of Alice C Hughes for my PhD (2016-today).
