## Hi there beautiful people ~ ~ ðŸ˜„
### Welcome to my happy place!
<br />
I graduated from Ph.D. program (yayy) June 2022. Currently navigating my new life as a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Biological Sciences, at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I still continue my bat-related work in Asia, as a continuous passion since undergrads and I have carried it (and dragged it) along the (not so smooth) way till this stage. My Ph.D. project focuses on bats Systematics, Ecology, and Evolution where I study the systematic and evolution of cryptic species, species delimitation and delineation, evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, and as well as bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. Currently, I am continuing my research to assess the bats movements using stable isotopes, dietary ecology, and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform-sympatric species and the macroevolutionary of bats in general, as well as biogeography. Well, a bit here and there ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¦‡
<br />
Cheers!
