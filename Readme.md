## Hi there~~
### Welcome to my happy place!
<br />
I just graduated from my PhD program (yayy) last June, 2022. Currently navigating my new life as postdoctoral fellows in School of Biological Sciences, the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I still continue my bat-related works in Asia, as a continous passion since undergrads and I have carrying it (and dragging it) along the (not so smooth) way till this stage. My Ph.D. project focuses on bats Systematics, Ecology and Evolution where I studies the systematic and evolution of cryptic species, species delimitation and delineation, evolutionary history and historical biogeography, estimating the ancestral traits and ancestral species ranges, and as well as bioacoustic, and the ecology of bats. Currently I am continuing my research to assess the bats movements using stable isotopes, dietary ecology and niche differentiation of morphologically uniform sympatric species and the macroevolutionary of bats in general, as well as biogeography.

However, I am still a learner, willing to learn about everything, trying to keep up with the latest advance statistical analyses and methodology in sciences. I am a self-taught on the data analyses and this page to stored all related packages and all related data analyses programs I use. One of my favorite analyses I am running so far is ancestral range estimation which implemented in R package BioGeoBEARS, and still expanding it to get better and robust result. Aside from that, I have been using a wide range of phylogenetic-related programs and species delimitations such as MAFFT, IQTREE, MrBAYES, BEAST, BPP, etc which are forked on this page for easy access as future references. Future excitement for me, personally, including bioinformatics analysis that will be stored in this page.

As a side note, I am a proud field biologist; spending most of the time in the field collecting data in the caves and karsts. My field sites covers underground habitat across Southern China till Southeast Asia and I never get tired of it.
